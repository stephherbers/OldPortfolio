Hello! Welcome to my portfolio!

The images within this repositiory are some of the work I have done as a Graphic 
Designer for the Music Department at Carleton College.

For each event, the director can request that a poster be made.
My job is to take their vision and vibe of the show and turn tha into a poster 
that is put up around school, and the website. 

All poster have been made with Photoshop, or a combination of Photoshop and Illistrator.

Please email any questions you have at herberss@carleton.edu


Thanks!
