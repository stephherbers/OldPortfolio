Hello! Welcome to my portfolio!

This repositiory contains both Graphic Design work, and also computer science work, each on seperate branches.

To navigate, you can use the dropdown labelled "branches," or if you are more familiar with git you can also navigate though terminal.

In the 'Graphic-Design-Work' branch, there are images of some of the work I have done as a Graphic 
Designer for the Music Department at Carleton College.

In the 'CS-Work' branch, there is projects from various computer science classes, or research conducted outside of school. These are mainly done in Python and Java, but also incluse HTML and CSS. Descriptions of each project are contained with the code.


Please email any questions you have at herberss@carleton.edu


Thanks!
